## Overview

**Lightning-Path** is a high-performance route recognizer library for Rust, designed to match URL patterns efficiently using the Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) concept. It allows you to define routes and quickly determine which route matches a given URL path, making it ideal for web frameworks and other applications requiring fast and reliable routing.
